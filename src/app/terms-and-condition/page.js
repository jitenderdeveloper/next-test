            Our Service allows users who register on the Platform and therefore
            create an account with us to earn extra discount by making purchases
            from the retailers listed on Our Platform. To qualify for the
            discount benefits, the Retailer must confirm that the Member’s
            purchase is tracked, genuine and successful (constituting a
            “Qualifying Transaction”). A transaction is termed to be a qualified
            transaction where, the user is redirected by Cashdost to the
            Retailer’s platform /Website making a valid and subsisting purchase
            after which the Product/service is duly delivered, and the
            refund/return period has also expired. In the event when the
            Retailers are not able to track a transaction using their affiliate
            tracking system,in such sales the benefit is not paid to Cashdost
            and hence any due or expected benefit from these sales will also not
            be paid to the Member.
